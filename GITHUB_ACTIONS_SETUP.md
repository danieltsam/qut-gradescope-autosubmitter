# Automation Setup Guide: Git Hooks & GitHub Actions

This comprehensive guide explains how to set up automated Gradescope submissions using Git hooks (local automation) and GitHub Actions (cloud automation).

## üéØ Automation Overview

The QUT Gradescope Auto Submitter supports multiple automation approaches:

1. **ü™ù Git Hooks** - Local automation that runs on every commit
2. **ü§ñ GitHub Actions** - Cloud-based automation for pushes, schedules, and manual triggers  
3. **üîÑ Combined Setup** - Use both for maximum automation coverage

---

## ü™ù Git Hooks (Local Automation)

Git hooks automatically run Gradescope submissions when you commit code locally. This provides immediate feedback and works entirely on your machine.

### üöÄ Quick Setup

**Interactive Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
gradescope hooks
```

This opens an interactive menu with all options:
- Install full hooks (submit + wait for grade)
- Install quick hooks (submit only, no grade wait)
- View current hooks
- Remove hooks

### üìã Hook Types

#### Full Hooks (With Grade Monitoring)
- **Command**: `gradescope submit --headless`
- **Behavior**: Submit to Gradescope and wait for grade feedback
- **Use Case**: Interactive development when you want immediate grade results
- **Time**: 30 seconds to several minutes (depending on grading speed)

#### Quick Hooks (Submit Only)
- **Command**: `gradescope submit --headless --no-grade-wait`
- **Behavior**: Submit to Gradescope but don't wait for grades
- **Use Case**: Rapid development cycles, CI/CD pipelines
- **Time**: Usually under 10 seconds

### ‚è∞ Hook Timing

#### Pre-commit Hooks
- **When**: Runs **before** your commit is finalized
- **Advantage**: Ensures submission happens even if you forget
- **Consideration**: May delay your commit process

#### Post-commit Hooks  
- **When**: Runs **after** your commit is saved
- **Advantage**: Doesn't block the commit process
- **Consideration**: Submission happens after commit is already saved

### üîß Manual Hook Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

#### 1. Create Hooks Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .git/hooks
```

#### 2. Create Pre-commit Hook (Full Mode)
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-commit hook for Gradescope submissions (with grade monitoring)
echo "Pre-commit: Checking for gradescope.yml..."

if [ -f "gradescope.yml" ]; then
    echo "Found gradescope.yml, running submission with grade monitoring..."
    gradescope submit --headless
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Gradescope submission and grading completed successfully"
    else
        echo "Gradescope submission failed"
        echo "Commit will proceed anyway..."
    fi
else
    echo "No gradescope.yml found, skipping submission"
fi
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### 3. Create Post-commit Hook (Quick Mode)
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/post-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Post-commit hook for Gradescope submissions (quick mode)
echo "Post-commit: Checking for gradescope.yml..."

if [ -f "gradescope.yml" ]; then
    echo "Found gradescope.yml, running quick submission..."
    gradescope submit --headless --no-grade-wait
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Gradescope submission successful (not waiting for grade)"
    else
        echo "Gradescope submission failed"
    fi
else
    echo "No gradescope.yml found, skipping submission"
fi
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### üì± Example Workflows

#### Development with Full Hooks
```bash
git add solution.py
git commit -m "Implement bubble sort algorithm"
# ‚Üí Pre-commit hook runs
# ‚Üí Submits to Gradescope
# ‚Üí Waits for grade
# ‚Üí Shows: "Grade returned after 0:45: 15.0 / 15.0 (100%)"
# ‚Üí Commit completes
```

#### Rapid Development with Quick Hooks
```bash
git add *.py
git commit -m "Work in progress - testing approach"
# ‚Üí Post-commit hook runs
# ‚Üí Quick submission to Gradescope
# ‚Üí "Gradescope submission successful (not waiting for grade)"
# ‚Üí Continue coding immediately
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Hook Management

#### View Current Hooks
```bash
gradescope hooks
# Choose option 4: "View current hooks"
```

#### Remove Hooks
```bash
gradescope hooks
# Choose option 5: "Remove hooks"
```

#### Manual Hook Removal
```bash
rm -f .git/hooks/pre-commit
rm -f .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### üí° Best Practices

1. **Choose Your Mode**: Use full hooks for final submissions, quick hooks for development
2. **Test First**: Run `gradescope submit` manually before setting up hooks
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use post-commit quick hooks for development, manually run full submissions for grades
4. **Team Projects**: Document your hook setup in your project README

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions (Cloud Automation)

GitHub Actions provide cloud-based automation that runs in GitHub's servers. Perfect for team projects, scheduled submissions, and CI/CD integration.

### üöÄ Quick Setup

**All-in-One Setup Script:**
```bash
python setup_automation.py
```

This script provides an interactive setup for:
- GitHub repository secrets and variables
- Workflow files
- Configuration
- Git integration

### üîê Repository Configuration

#### 1. Repository Secrets

Navigate to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and add:

- **`GRADESCOPE_USERNAME`**: Your QUT student number (e.g., `n12345678`)
- **`GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD`**: Your QUT password

#### 2. Repository Variables

Add these variables in the same location:

- **`GRADESCOPE_COURSE`**: Your course code (e.g., `cab201`)
- **`GRADESCOPE_ASSIGNMENT`**: Your assignment name (e.g., `t6q1`)

### üìÅ Workflow Files

Create these files in `.github/workflows/`:

#### Auto-Submit on Push
**File**: `.github/workflows/auto-submit.yml`

          --course "${{ matrix.assignment.course }}" \
          --assignment "${{ matrix.assignment.assignment }}"
```

### üîß Configuration Setup

Create `gradescope.yml` in your repository root:

```yaml
course: "cab201"
assignment: "t6q1"
files:
  - "*.py"
  - "*.java"
  - "*.cpp"
  - "*.c"
  - "requirements.txt"
  - "README.md"
exclude:
  - "__pycache__/"
  - "*.pyc"
  - ".git/"
  - "node_modules/"
```

### üì± Usage Examples

#### Automatic on Push
```bash
git add solution.py
git push origin main
# ‚Üí GitHub Action triggers automatically
# ‚Üí Submits to Gradescope in the cloud
# ‚Üí Check Actions tab for results
```

#### Manual Trigger
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Select **Manual Submit to Gradescope**
4. Click **Run workflow**
5. Fill in parameters (optional)
6. Click **Run workflow**

#### Scheduled Submissions
- Automatically runs daily at the scheduled time
- Perfect for deadline reminders
- Check Actions tab for logs

---

## üîÑ Combined Setup: Git Hooks + GitHub Actions

For maximum automation coverage, use both:

### Local Development Flow
```bash
# Work locally with Git hooks
git add *.py
git commit -m "Implement solution"
# ‚Üí Git hook submits locally
# ‚Üí Get immediate feedback

# Push to share with team
git push origin main
# ‚Üí GitHub Action submits from cloud
# ‚Üí Team can see results in Actions tab
```

### Configuration

1. **Git Hooks**: Quick local feedback
2. **GitHub Actions**: Team visibility and backup submissions
3. **Scheduled Actions**: Deadline reminders

### Best Practices

1. **Local Hooks**: Use quick mode for development
2. **GitHub Actions**: Use full mode for official submissions
3. **Documentation**: Document your automation setup for teammates
4. **Testing**: Test both locally and in GitHub before deadlines

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Git Hooks Issues

**Hook not running:**
```bash
# Check if hook file exists and is executable
ls -la .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

**Unicode errors on Windows:**
```bash
# Hooks should not contain emojis or special characters
# Use the interactive setup to create clean hooks
gradescope hooks
```

### GitHub Actions Issues

**Credentials not working:**
- Verify secrets are set correctly in repository settings
- Check that variable names match exactly
- Ensure QUT credentials are valid

**Workflow not triggering:**
- Check branch names in workflow files
- Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- Check Actions tab for error messages

**Submission failures:**
- Run `gradescope doctor` locally first
- Check that `gradescope.yml` is valid
- Verify course and assignment names

### General Issues

**Configuration problems:**
```bash
gradescope validate  # Check configuration
gradescope doctor    # Check system requirements
```

**Session issues:**
```bash
gradescope cleanup   # Clear saved sessions
```
