**üîí Production-ready automation for QUT Gradescope submissions**

Secure ‚Ä¢ Fast ‚Ä¢ Reliable ‚Ä¢ CI/CD Ready

[Installation](#installation) ‚Ä¢ [Quick Start](#quick-start) ‚Ä¢ [GitHub Actions](#github-actions) ‚Ä¢ [Documentation](#documentation)

> **üí° Why I built this:** As a QUT student, I was frustrated with the repetitive click-heavy Gradescope submission process. I enjoy CLI tools and automation, so I built this to streamline my workflow and make submissions as simple as `gradescope submit`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

**Legal & Responsibility:**
- This tool is provided "as-is" without any warranties or guarantees
- Users are solely responsible for their use of this tool and any consequences
- The authors and contributors are not responsible for:
  - Misuse of the tool or violation of university policies
  - Failed submissions, missed deadlines, or academic consequences
  - Any issues arising from automated submission attempts
  - Rate limiting or account restrictions imposed by QUT or Gradescope

**Rate Limiting & Usage:**
- **Fresh Login Mode**: Using `--fresh-login` or `always_fresh_login: true` creates new sessions every time
- **Manual Login Mode**: Using `--manual-login` also triggers new login requests to QUT SSO
- Both modes may trigger rate limiting on QUT SSO if used excessively
- **Recommended**: Use session persistence (default) to minimize SSO requests
- **Best Practice**: Avoid running multiple submissions in rapid succession

**University Policies:**
- Ensure your use complies with QUT's academic integrity policies
- This tool is intended for legitimate assignment submission automation only
- Users are responsible for understanding and following their institution's rules

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations

> **üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This tool **requires at least one prior manual submission** to each assignment before it can be used for automation.

**Assignment Requirement:**
- This tool only works with **existing assignments** that already have submissions on Gradescope
- It **cannot create new submissions** for assignments you haven't submitted to before
- You must make at least one manual submission through the Gradescope web interface first
- After the initial manual submission, this tool can handle all subsequent submissions automatically

**Quick Setup for New Assignments:**
1. Go to Gradescope website manually
2. Submit your assignment once (any file is fine)
3. Use this tool for all future submissions to that assignment

> **üí° Why this limitation exists**: Gradescope's interface changes based on whether an assignment has previous submissions, making automation impossible without this initial step.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Install the package from TestPyPI
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter

# Install browser dependencies  
playwright install chromium
```

> **üì¶ TestPyPI Note:** This package is currently available on TestPyPI for testing. Once stable, it will be published to the main PyPI repository.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency Issue:** TestPyPI has limited package availability. If you get Playwright version errors, try installing dependencies separately first:
> ```bash
> pip install playwright pyyaml python-dotenv click
> pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter
playwright install chromium
> ```

### Platform Notes

**Windows:** If you get permission errors, try `pip install --user -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter`

**Linux/Mac:** You may need `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration

```bash
# Create config file
gradescope init

# Check system requirements
gradescope doctor
```

### 2. Set Credentials

**üîê Credentials Management**
```bash
gradescope credentials  # Guide for setting up credentials
```

**Available Methods:**

**Option A: Session Environment Variables**

**Linux/Mac (Bash/Zsh):**
```bash
export GRADESCOPE_USERNAME="n12345678"
export GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD="your_password"
# Lasts until terminal closes
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GRADESCOPE_USERNAME = "n12345678"
$env:GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD = "your_password"
# Lasts until terminal closes
```

**Option B: .env File (Good for development)**
```bash
# Create .env file in project directory
GRADESCOPE_USERNAME=n12345678
GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD=your_password
```

> **üí° Pro tip:** The `.env` file is automatically loaded when you run any command, so you don't need to set environment variables every time you open a new terminal!

**Option C: Permanent Environment Variables**

**Windows PowerShell (Permanent):**
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GRADESCOPE_USERNAME", "n12345678", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD", "your_password", "User")
# Restart terminal after this
```

**Linux/Mac (Permanent):**
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.profile
echo 'export GRADESCOPE_USERNAME="n12345678"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD="your_password"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**üîê Security & Persistence Comparison:**

| Method | Security Level | Convenience | Duration | When to Use |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Session env vars** | üü¢ High | üü° Medium | Terminal session | Quick testing |
| **.env file** | üü° Medium | üü¢ High | Until deleted | Development projects |
| **Permanent env vars** | üü° Medium | üü¢ High | Forever | Power users |
| **Manual login** | üü¢ Highest | üü° Medium | None | Maximum security |

### 3. Configure Assignment

Edit `gradescope.yml`:
```yaml
# Course Details (edit these!)
course: cab201
assignment: t6q1
zip_name: submission.zip
bundle: ['*']

# Behavior Settings
always_fresh_login: false
headless: false
notify_when_graded: true
manual_login: false
no_session_save: false
```

### 4. Submit

```bash
gradescope submit
```

```

## üîß Configuration

### YAML Configuration File

```yaml
# gradescope.yml
course: cab201
assignment: t6q1
file: submission.zip
bundle:
  - "*.py"
  - "*.cpp" 
  - "src/**/*"
notify_when_graded: true
headless: false
```

### Environment Variables

All config options can be overridden with environment variables:

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export GRADESCOPE_USERNAME="n12345678"
export GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD="your_password"
export GRADESCOPE_COURSE="cab201"
export GRADESCOPE_ASSIGNMENT="t6q1"
export GRADESCOPE_FILE="submission.zip"
export GRADESCOPE_BUNDLE="*.py,*.cpp,*.h"
export GRADESCOPE_NOTIFY_WHEN_GRADED="true"
export GRADESCOPE_HEADLESS="false"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GRADESCOPE_USERNAME = "n12345678"
$env:GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD = "your_password"
$env:GRADESCOPE_COURSE = "cab201"
$env:GRADESCOPE_ASSIGNMENT = "t6q1"
$env:GRADESCOPE_FILE = "submission.zip"
$env:GRADESCOPE_BUNDLE = "*.py,*.cpp,*.h"
$env:GRADESCOPE_NOTIFY_WHEN_GRADED = "true"
$env:GRADESCOPE_HEADLESS = "false"
```

## üîí Security Options

### Session Management

By default, the tool uses **session persistence** for efficiency:
- **First submission**: Login once (3-5 seconds)
- **Subsequent submissions**: Reuse session (1 second)
- **Session expires**: Auto re-login when needed

### Enhanced Security Options

For enhanced security, you have several options:

**Option 1: Manual Login (Highest Security)**
```bash
gradescope submit --manual-login
# Opens browser, you type credentials directly
# Tool never touches your passwords
```

**Option 2: Fresh Login (High Security)**
```yaml
# Config file
always_fresh_login: true  # Always login fresh
```
```bash
# Command line
gradescope submit --fresh-login  # One-time fresh login
```

**What "fresh login" means:**
- Ignores any saved session data
- Forces a complete new login process
- Useful for troubleshooting or when session data is corrupted

### üéõÔ∏è YAML Configuration

All security flags can be set in your `gradescope.yml`:

```yaml
# Course Details (edit these!)
course: cab201
assignment: t6q1
zip_name: submission.zip
bundle: ['*']

# Behavior Settings (can be overridden by CLI flags)
always_fresh_login: false    # Force fresh login every time
headless: false
notify_when_graded: true
manual_login: false          # Open browser for manual login
no_session_save: false       # Don't save credentials to session vars
```

### üéØ Flag Purpose Guide

**When to use each security flag:**

| Flag | Purpose | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **`--manual-login`** | You type credentials directly in browser | **Maximum security** - tool never sees passwords |
| **`--fresh-login`** | Always login fresh, ignore session | **Troubleshooting** - force clean login |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limiting Note**: Both `--manual-login` and `--fresh-login` trigger new SSO requests and may cause rate limiting with frequent use.

**Typical workflows:**
- **Most users**: Set environment variables or .env file, then run `gradescope submit`
- **Maximum security**: `gradescope submit --manual-login`
- **Development**: Set permanent env vars or .env file
- **Troubleshooting**: `gradescope submit --fresh-login`

### Manual Session Management
```bash
gradescope cleanup  # Clear saved session data
```

**What `gradescope cleanup` does:**
- Removes all saved browser session data
- Clears cookies and local storage
- Forces fresh login on next submission
- Useful when switching between different QUT accounts

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Status**: GitHub Actions integration is **not yet fully tested** and may require additional configuration. Use with caution.

Automate submissions on every commit!

> üìñ **Detailed Setup Guide**: See [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for comprehensive setup instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced configurations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limiting Warning**: GitHub Actions will trigger new login requests for each run, which may trigger QUT SSO rate limiting if you have frequent commits. Consider using scheduled submissions instead of commit-based submissions for high-frequency repositories.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Previous Submission Required**: GitHub Actions workflows require assignments to have at least one prior manual submission before automation can work.

### Setup

1. **Add Repository Secrets** (`Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions`):
   - `GRADESCOPE_USERNAME`: Your QUT student number
   - `GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD`: Your QUT password

2. **Add Repository Variables**:
   - `GRADESCOPE_COURSE`: Course code (e.g., `cab201`)
   - `GRADESCOPE_ASSIGNMENT`: Assignment name (e.g., `t6q1`)

3. **Add Workflow** (`.github/workflows/auto-submit.yml`):

```yaml
name: Auto Submit to Gradescope

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  submit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
        
    - name: Install and submit
      env:
        GRADESCOPE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.GRADESCOPE_USERNAME }}
        GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD }}
        GRADESCOPE_COURSE: ${{ vars.GRADESCOPE_COURSE }}
        GRADESCOPE_ASSIGNMENT: ${{ vars.GRADESCOPE_ASSIGNMENT }}
      run: |
        pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter
        playwright install chromium
        gradescope submit --headless --no-grade-wait
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Config file not found"**
```bash
gradescope init  # Create default config
```

**"Course/Assignment not found"**
- Use partial matching: `cab201` matches `CAB201_24se2`
- Check exact names on Gradescope website
- Try shorter search terms

**"Assignment submission failed" or "Assignment not available"**
- **This tool requires at least one prior submission** to the assignment
- Go to Gradescope manually and submit once (any file works)
- Then use this tool for all future submissions
- The tool cannot create new assignment submissions

**"strict mode violation: locator resolved to 3 elements"**
- This error means the assignment has no previous submissions
- Make one manual submission through Gradescope web interface first
- Then the CLI tool will work for all subsequent submissions

**"Browser timeout"**
```bash
gradescope submit --headless  # Try headless mode
```

**"Credentials not found"**

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
export GRADESCOPE_USERNAME="n12345678"
export GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GRADESCOPE_USERNAME = "n12345678"
$env:GRADESCOPE_PASSWORD = "your_password"
```
