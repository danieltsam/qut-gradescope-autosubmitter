> **üí° Why I built this:** As a QUT student, I was frustrated with the repetitive click-heavy Gradescope submission process. I enjoy CLI tools and automation, so I built this to streamline my workflow and make submissions as simple as `gradescope submit`.

## ‚ú® Features

### üé® **Rich Terminal UI**
Built with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) for a beautiful command-line experience inspired by modern CLI tools like Claude Code. Features panels, tables, progress indicators, and custom color themes that make terminal work enjoyable and pretty!

### üîê **Flexible Credential Management**
- **Multiple Options**: Environment variables, .env files, or interactive prompts
- **User-Level Storage**: Credentials work across all your projects
- **Session Persistence**: Stay logged in between submissions
- **Manual Login Mode**: Maximum security with browser-based authentication

### ‚ö° **Smart Automation**
- **Intelligent Bundling**: Automatic file detection with .gitignore support
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Find courses and assignments so long as they partially match the name on Gradescope
- **Grade Monitoring**: Wait for and display grades automatically
- **CI/CD Ready**: Can be used as a Git Hook locally or Github Action

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience**
- **Interactive Setup**: Guided configuration and credential management
- **Professional Help System**: Beautiful help pages and command documentation
- **System Diagnostics**: Built-in doctor command for troubleshooting
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux support

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This tool automates the manual Gradescope submission process using browser automation:

**üîç What the tool does:**
1. **üîê Logs into QUT SSO** - Handles university single sign-on automatically
2. **üéØ Navigates Gradescope** - Finds your course and assignment using smart matching
3. **üì¶ Bundles your files** - Creates a zip from your project files (respects .gitignore)
4. **‚ö° Submits automatically** - Handles both new submissions and resubmissions seamlessly
5. **üìä Monitors grading** - Waits for and displays your grade when ready

**üé≠ What Playwright does:**
- **Browser automation framework** - Controls a real Chromium browser programmatically
- **Cross-platform** - Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Reliable** - Handles dynamic web content, JavaScript, and complex interactions
- **Headless capable** - Can run invisibly in the background or show the browser (because it's always fun to watch an automated browser)

**üîí Security approach:**
- **No credential storage** in the tool itself - uses your system's environment variables or local .env files
- **Session persistence** - Remembers your login between submissions (like staying logged in on a website)
- **Local execution** - Everything runs on your machine, not on external servers

This eliminates the repetitive clicking through Gradescope's interface while maintaining the same security as manual submission.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Install the package from TestPyPI
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter

# Install browser dependencies  
playwright install chromium
```

> **üì¶ TestPyPI Note:** This package is currently available on TestPyPI for testing. Once stable, it will be published to the main PyPI repository.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Dependency Issue:** TestPyPI has limited package availability. If you get Playwright version errors, try installing dependencies separately first:
> ```bash
> pip install playwright pyyaml python-dotenv click rich
> pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter
> playwright install chromium
> ```

### Platform Notes

**Windows:** If you get permission errors, try `pip install --user -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ qut-gradescope-autosubmitter`

**Linux/Mac:** You may need `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. System Check & Setup

```bash
# Check system requirements and see the beautiful interface
gradescope doctor

# Create config file with guided setup
gradescope init

# Customize your UI interface colors (optional but fun!)
gradescope ui
```

### 2. Set Credentials

**üé® Interactive Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
gradescope credentials
# Navigate the beautiful menus:
# 1. Manage .env credentials ‚Üí Save/update credentials
# 2. Environment variables ‚Üí See copyable commands
# 3. View current status ‚Üí Check what's configured
```

The credentials system offers multiple options:
- **User-level .env file**: Works across all projects
- **Project-level .env file**: Project-specific credentials  
- **Environment variables**: Session-based or permanent
- **Interactive prompts**: Enter credentials when needed

> **üìñ Complete Guide:** See [CREDENTIALS.md](CREDENTIALS.md) for detailed setup, security notes, and troubleshooting.

### 3. Configure Assignment

Edit `gradescope.yml`:
```yaml
# Course Details (edit these!)
course: cab201
assignment: t6q1
zip_name: submission.zip
bundle: ['*']

# Behavior Settings
always_fresh_login: false
headless: false
notify_when_graded: true
manual_login: false
no_session_save: false
```

### 4. Submit & Enjoy

```bash
gradescope submit
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

**Assignment Support:**
- **Automatic detection**: Works with any assignment without manual setup
- **Universal compatibility**: Handles all submission interfaces seamlessly
- **Limitation**: If QUT or Gradescope change their SSO/UI, this tool breaks

**Legal & Responsibility:**
- This tool is provided "as-is" without any warranties or guarantees
- Users are solely responsible for their use of this tool and any consequences
- The authors and contributors are not responsible for:
  - Misuse of the tool or violation of university policies
  - Failed submissions, missed deadlines, or academic consequences
  - Any issues arising from automated submission attempts
  - Rate limiting or account restrictions imposed by QUT or Gradescope

**Rate Limiting & Usage:**
- **Fresh Login Mode**: Using `--fresh-login` or `always_fresh_login: true` creates new sessions every time
- **Manual Login Mode**: Using `--manual-login` also triggers new login requests to QUT SSO
- Both modes may trigger rate limiting on QUT SSO if used excessively
- **Recommended**: Use session persistence (default) to minimize SSO requests
- **Best Practice**: Avoid running multiple submissions in rapid succession

**University Policies:**
- Ensure your use complies with QUT's academic integrity policies
- This tool is intended for legitimate assignment submission automation only
- Users are responsible for understanding and following their institution's rules
